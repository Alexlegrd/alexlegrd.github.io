        <h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
        <p align="center">I live with my parents and I have siblings. One sister and two brothers and they are amazing. I'm the older and I'll
            be junior at George Washington High school ( 2018-2019). My sister will be sophmore and one of my brother will
            be in 6th grade bext year and one will be in 7th grade. My Goal is that I want to success in my life and I want
            to go to the college after my graduation in High school. I start to learn computer Science (2017-2018) and it
            was great to learn something that I always watch on TV and I never try to do that, but now I did and I can made
            a webpage. I studied computer tech support in africa during summer in 2016 and it was a business man who taught
            me. I was helping my family that time with money because I knew what i was doing and try to repair computer of
            people.I started to go to school when I was 4 years old and that time my country had a political problem and
            religious. I continued to going to school but I did not have a good school year like others kids in USA or in
            the world. There, they taught us in our native language called Kaba and Sangho. In 2010 the country was bad with
            a civil War and my family left my country and we went to the neighboring country to find a refuge and there was
            Cameroon my father found us school and it was really hard for him to take care of us because he did not have
            money. I went to school and learned french like I learn english now. In Cameroon I was in scientific class and
            I studied Spanish and Germany but I learned more spanish with foreign people. In 2016, I left Cameroon to come
            in USA and I came in November 15, 2016. I did not know english at all but I studied day by day to know english
            like other kids in USA.</p>
